      <p><strong>Montréal's otherwise regular street grid is broken at various points by rail right of ways, in use by 
      either its commuter rail network (EXO) or freight rail (CP Rail). </strong><br><br> This project focuses on the rail dividing the boroughs of Plateau Mont Royal 
      and Outremont in the South from the boroughs of Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension and Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. <br><br>
    
      The mapping of formal and informal crossings shows the extent to which this rail forms a barrier to (pedestrian) network connectivity. Conversely, it also 
      shows the opportunities for the redesign of public space to better allow users of all mobility to access their 
      homes, their workplaces, and other places of interest - work that is already undertaken by the City in the case of the new 
      crossing planned at the De l'Épée crossing in Outremont. <br> <br>
      
      This project was made by Michael Rhamey for GEOG 464 at Concordia University.
