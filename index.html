      <p><strong>Montréal's otherwise regular street grid is broken at various points by rail right of ways, in use by 
      either its commuter rail network (EXO) or freight rail (CP Rail). </strong><br><br> This project focuses on the rail dividing the boroughs of Plateau Mont Royal 
      and Outremont in the South from the boroughs of Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension and Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. <br><br>
    
      The mapping of formal and informal crossings shows the extent to which this rail forms a barrier to (pedestrian) network connectivity. Conversely, it also 
      shows the opportunities for the redesign of public space to better allow users of all mobility to access their 
      homes, their workplaces, and other places of interest - work that is already undertaken by the City in the case of the new 
      crossing planned at the De l'Épée crossing in Outremont. <br> <br>
      
      This project was made by Michael Rhamey for GEOG 464 at Concordia University.

TThe CP rail right-of-way was built in 1876 as part of the Montreal Northern Colonization Railway, leading north from central Montréal (down by Papineau and St Catherine) into the Laurentides. A Mile End station was constructed as part of the development and incorporation of the area; it operated until 1931 and was demolished in 1970. Purchased by Canadian Pacific in 1882, the line is still in use to transfer freight and locomotives between yards in Côte Saint-Luc and the Port of Montréal.

Montreal has since developed into the urban form and communities we know today, with the right-of-way serving to separate the boroughs of Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension, Outremont, the Plateau Mont-Royal, and Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie. The Reseau Vert mixed-use path now runs for a good portion of its length and forms the basis of the study area. 

The right-of-way still finds itself at the center of the area’s continued development. The area began to gentrify in the 1980s and 1990s and now hosts thousands of jobs in converted warehouses and other formerly industrial buildings. Further west, between Outremont and Acadie, the rail line now forms the northern border of the Campus MIL development, where the Université de Montréal is in the process of developing its campus, and the City is leading various infrastructure and services around the area. Two new crossings arrive with this project; the mixed-use overpass aligned with Blvd. Acadie, and a new level crossing aligned at de l’Épée. 

Beginning in the 1980s, the construction of the Réseau Vert multi-use path along the majority of its length allows for a separated right-of-way for pedestrians and cyclists to efficiently traverse the grid of streets, despite the obstacle to connectivity that it presents transversally (across the lines). 

More recently, the line attracts attention due to the number of fines and fatalities that occur due to trespassing onto the right-of-way, most often by commuters and neighbours trying to cut a few minutes off their journeys to work or homes. In 2022
